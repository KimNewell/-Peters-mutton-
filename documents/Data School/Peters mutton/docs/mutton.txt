Mutton Flavour
Fatty acids including MOA, EOA and MNA accumulate in lamb meat and can make meat from older animals taste unpleasant. Another fatty acid, C17:0, also accumlates with age although is not responsible for the unpleasant 'mutton flavour'. C17 is easier to measure than MOA, EOA or MNA; this study investigates whether C17 could be a useful 'proxy' for indicating how 'muttony' meat is likely to taste.
